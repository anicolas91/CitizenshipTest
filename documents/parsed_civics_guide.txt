THE U.S. CONSTITUTION
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏The U.S. Constitution. 
 ❏When the Constitution was written.
 ❏What the Constitution says.
 ❏Why the Constitution is the most important document in 
the United States government.
The U.S. Constitution was written in 1787. It is the oldest written 
constitution in the world. The Constitution sets up the government 
and protects the basic rights of people living in the United States. 
The Constitution was written during the period when the country was created. Another word for created is “founded. ” The period when the country was created is called the Founding Era. In 1787, famous leaders from around the country like George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton came to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a Constitutional Convention. The leaders who met at the Constitutional Convention are sometimes called the Founders. The Founders wrote the Constitution at the Constitutional Convention 
When the Founders wrote the Constitution in 1787, it had a Preamble and seven sections. There have been changes made to the Constitution since it was written.  A change to the Constitution is called an amendment 
There are 27 amendments to the 
Constitution. The 27 amendments are listed after the seven 
sections of the original Constitution. 
The beginning of the Constitution is called the Preamble. The Preamble 
to the Constitution explains why the Founders wrote the Constitution. 
The Preamble also says that under the Constitution, the people of the 
United States will have self-government. This means that the people of the United States are not governed by a king or a queen. Instead, the people of the United States govern themselves. The people of the United States govern themselves by electing representatives who serve in the local, state, and U.S. governments.
The idea of self-government is in the first three words of the  
Constitution. These words are, “We the people” 
The Constitution of the United States.

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
The Three Branches of Government
The first three sections of the Constitution set up the U.S. government.  
These sections of the Constitution describe the three branches or parts of the U.S. government. The U.S. 
government is also called the federal government. 
The three branches of government are called the Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, and the 
Judicial Branch.

 ●The President’s Cabinet 
 ○In government, a “cabinet” is another word for a “group of advisors. ” The President’s Cabinet advises the President 
 ●The Executive Departments and agencies in the U.S. government  
The parts of the Judicial Branch are the Supreme Court and other federal courts. The Supreme Court is the 
highest court in the U.S..

Separation of Powers
During the Constitutional Convention, the Founders were afraid that if one person or group has too much 
power, then they could take over the country. They decided to separate the powers of government so that no one person or group could become too powerful. The Constitution gives each branch of government different powers. This is called “separation of powers. ” Separation of powers stops one branch from becoming too powerful 
The powers of each branch of government are: 
 ● The Legislative Branch (Congress) makes federal laws.
 ● The Executive Branch enforces federal laws.
 ● The Judicial Branch reviews federal laws.

The Constitution also lists the powers that the federal government has, such as the power to protect the 
people of the United States. 
For example, under the Constitution, the federal government has the power to create an army  to defend 
the nation, and to declare war 41 if the U.S. has been attacked or is under threat. 
The federal government also has the power to make treaties.
A treaty is an agreement between two or more countries. Sometimes 
the federal government signs treaties with other countries to end wars or conflicts. Other times, the federal government signs treaties with countries to work together on issues like trade.
Another power that the federal government has under the  
Constitution is to print money 
Only the U.S. government 
has the power to print the dollar bills and coins that people use for  
money in the United States.

STATE GOVERNMENTS
The fourth section of the Constitution explains how state governments 
are set up. This section also explains how new states can join the  United States.  
The Constitution says that each state will have a government that  
has a legislative branch, an executive branch, and a judicial branch. 
The person in charge of the executive branch for a state government  
is a called a governor. Each of the 50 states has a governor.  To find out who is the governor of your state now, please visit:  usa.gov/state-governor 
Under the Constitution, state governments also have certain powers.
For example, state governments have the power to provide the 
people of their state with protection and safety. One way that 
state governments do this is by providing the people in their state with police departments and fire departments.
State governments also have the power to provide the people of 
their state with schooling and education 
Each state in the U.S. 
has its own educational system for students in grade school, colleges and universities, and adult education programs. Washington, D.C., does not have a governor because it is not a U.S. state. Washington, D.C., residents should answer that D.C. does not have a governor.

 Fighting fires is among a state’s powers.CHANGING THE CONSTITUTION
The fifth section of the Constitution explains how  
the Constitution can be changed. A change to the Constitution is called an amendment 
The 
Founders wanted the people of the United States to be able to make changes to the Constitution. They believed that in order to have self-government, the people of the United States should be able to make changes to the Constitution and the government. 
For an amendment to be added to the Constitution  
it must be approved by three-fourths of the states  
in the United States. Today there are 50 states in  
the U.S. That means that 38 out of the 50 states 
must approve an amendment for it to be added to the Constitution. There are 27 amendments to the Constitution 
SUPREME LAW OF THE LAND
The sixth section of the Constitution says the 
Constitution is the supreme law of the land in the United States 
This means that everyone living 
in the United States must follow the Constitution. In the United States, we support the “rule of law. ” This means that we believe that no one is above the law, and everyone must follow the law 
This also 
means that the U.S. government, state governments, and local governments must follow the Constitution and the rule of law.

APPROVING THE CONSTITUTION
The seventh section of the  
Constitution says that the people of the United States had to approve the Constitution for it to become the law of the land. When the Founders wrote the Constitution, there were 13 states in the U.S. The Constitution says that nine of the 13 original states must approve the Constitution. In 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve the Constitution, and all 13 original states approved the Constitution by 1790.This map identifies the 
13 original states and when they approved

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION
When the Constitution was written in 1787, it did not list any of 
the rights of individuals. Many of the Founders believed that the Constitution should include a list of the rights of people living in the United States. 
The Founders decided to add 10 amendments to the Constitution.  
The first 10 amendments to the Constitution are called the Bill of Rights 
The Bill of Rights lists some of the basic rights of people 
living in the United States. 
There are 27 amendments to the Constitution. Some of  
the amendments that were added to the Constitution after the  
Bill of Rights describe who can be a U.S. citizen, and who can vote  in elections in the United States.

THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH (CONGRESS)
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏The Legislative Branch of the U.S. government.
 ❏The House of Representatives. ❏The Senate.
 ❏The process for making federal laws. 
The Legislative Branch is one branch or part of the government. 
Another name for the Legislative Branch is the U.S. Congress.
The Constitution says that Congress makes federal laws. When 
the Founders were writing the Constitution, they believed that the 
power to make laws is the most important power in government. This is why the first section of the Constitution describes Congress and the power to make federal laws. 
During the Constitutional Convention, the Founders agreed that the 
people who make laws should represent the states or parts of states where they lived. 
When the Constitutional Convention started, the Founders did not agree 
on how many representatives each state should have in Congress. Some people thought that the number of representatives from each state should be based on the number of people living in the state. Others thought that each state should have the same number of representa-tives, no matter how many people lived in the state. They came to an agreement to have two parts to the U.S. Congress. The two parts to the U.S. Congress are the House of Representatives and the Senate 
States that have more people have more representatives in the House of Representatives

MAKING FEDERAL LAWS 
The Constitution says that Congress makes  
federal laws. A “law” is another word for a 
“rule” that people must follow. A “federal law” is another word for a “rule” that everyone in the  United States must follow.  
When members of Congress want to make a new 
law, they write a “bill. ” A bill is a proposal for a new law. For Congress to pass a bill, a majority of both the House of Representatives and the Senate must vote for it. This means that more than half of the voting members in the House of Representatives and U.S. Senators must vote in support of the bill. 
For example, there are 435 voting members in the 
House of Representatives 
For a bill to pass the 
House of Representatives, at least 218 voting members must vote in favor of the bill. 
There are 100 U.S. Senators in the Senate 
For most bills to pass the Senate, at least 51 U.S. 
Senators must vote in favor of it. 
If both parts of Congress pass the bill, then the bill is 
sent to the President of the United States.
If the President agrees with the bill, then the President 
signs the bill into law. This means that everyone 
in the country must follow the law that the President signed. 
If the President does not agree with the bill, then 
the President vetoes the bill 
The word “veto” 
means that the President did not sign the bill. Then the bill does not become a law.

THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏The Executive Branch. 
 ❏The President of the United States.
 ❏The agencies in the federal government. 
The Executive Branch is one branch or part of the U.S. government 
The President of the United States is in charge of the Executive 
Branch. 
The other parts of the Executive Branch are the President’s Cabinet, the 
Vice President of the United States, and the Executive Departments and agencies in the federal government. 
During the Constitutional Convention, the Founders were afraid  
that if the President had too much power, then the President would be 
above the law and could become a king or queen. The Founders believed that in the United States no one is above the law. This is called the “rule of law” 
The Founders believed that the President should 
have the power to protect and serve the people of the United States. They also believed that the President should follow the rule of law.  
THE PRESIDENT’S CABINET 
The Executive Branch includes the Executive Departments and agencies 
that are part of the federal government. The Executive Departments and agencies help the President to enforce laws, protect the country, work with other countries, and provide services to the people of the United States.  The people who lead the Executive Departments are mostly called Secretaries. For example, the person who leads the Department of Homeland Security is called the Secretary of Homeland Security.  U.S.  Government

The leaders of the Executive Departments are also called Cabinet-level positions because the people who lead each agency are part of the  President’s Cabinet. A “cabinet” is another word for a “group of advisors. ” The President’s Cabinet advises the President 
 The President can also choose to have other people from the federal  government serve on the Cabinet. 
Each Executive Department has many smaller agencies. For example, 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is part of the Department of Justice. Another example is U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS is part of the Department of Homeland Security.
 ●Vice President of the  United StatesThe leader of the Department of Justice 
is not called a “Secretary. ” The leader of the Department of Justice is called the Attorney General.

THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF 
The President of the United States is the 
Commander in Chief of the military. This 
means that the President is in charge of everyone 
serving in U.S. military. Another term for the U.S. 
military is the U.S. Armed Forces.  
In the United States, serving in the U.S. Armed 
Forces is voluntary. Today there are over 2 million people serving in the U.S. Armed Forces.  For more 
information about the U.S. Armed Forces, please visit: 
U.S. Department of Defense at www.defense.gov .There are six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces:

The Constitution says that in order to get elected 
President, a person must be 35 years old or older and was a U.S. citizen at birth.

THE JUDICIAL BRANCH
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏The Judicial Branch. 
 ❏The Supreme Court. 
The Judicial Branch is one branch or part of the government. 
The parts of the Judicial Branch are the Supreme Court and other 
federal courts. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States 
This means that the Supreme Court’s decision about a law 
or legal case is final. The other federal courts are sometimes called lower federal courts.
When the Founders wrote the Constitution, they did not want the 
judges who serve on the Supreme Court and on other federal courts to make decisions about the law based on politics or elections. Judges who serve on the Supreme Court and other federal courts are sometimes called federal judges. The Founders wanted federal judges to make decisions based on the Constitution and the rule of law. This is why federal judges are not elected to office. The President nominates someone to become a federal judge on the Supreme Court or on a lower federal court. That person must also be approved by the U.S. Senate to become a federal judge. 
The process for a person to become a federal judge is an example of 
the separation of powers of government because all three branches of government are involved. The separation of powers is important because it stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful 

================NEW PAGE================

One of the important roles of the Judicial Branch is to review laws 
This means that they can decide if a law follows the Constitution. 
In the United States, the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the 
Land. This means that everyone in the United States must follow 
the Constitution. This also means that the laws that Congress writes must also follow the Constitution. If someone in the United States thinks that a law does not follow the Constitution, that person can bring a legal case to a federal court to challenge the law. 
Each of the courts in the Judicial Branch can only review a law if there 
is a legal case before it. This means that the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts can only make a decision about a law or a legal case when they have the legal authority to hear a case that is brought before the court.
The Supreme Court may review a decision about a law or legal case 
from a lower federal court. If the Supreme Court reviews a decision about a law or legal case, then they must make a decision. There are no other courts in the United States that can change the decision of the Supreme Court. This is one reason that the Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States 
Statue of Lady Justice
Courtroom of the Supreme Court of the 
United States.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES
There are nine justices on the Supreme Court. The word “justice” 
is another word for “judge. ” After the Supreme Court reviews a case,  
the justices meet to discuss the case and vote on the decision. 
One justice on the Supreme Court is called the Chief Justice of the United 
States. The Chief Justice has many duties. Some of the duties are:
 ●Leading the other Supreme Court justices in choosing which  cases to hear.
 ●Managing the courtroom when the Supreme Court is hearing  a case.
 ●Leading discussions with other Supreme Court justices about  deciding a case. 
The Chief Justice serves as a leader on the Supreme Court, but the  justices make their own decisions when voting on each case. When a  majority of the justices vote the same way on a case, they write a  decision that explains their reasons.
To find the name of the current Chief Justice of the United States,  
please visit: supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx 
A majority means that more than half of the justices vote the same way on a case.  For example: When 9 Supreme Court Justices hear a case, at least 5 justices must vote the same on the case in order to have a majority.

RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏The Bill of Rights.
 ❏The rights and responsibilities of 
everyone living in the United States.  ❏The rights and responsibilities of  U.S. citizens.
Under our Constitution, individuals living in the United States have 
rights or freedoms. The word “freedom” is another word that means “right. ” Some rights belong to everyone living in the United States, and some rights only belong to U.S. citizens. 
After the Constitutional Convention, the people of the United States 
had to approve the Constitution. Many people in the country did not like the Constitution in 1787 because it did not include a list of rights. Some of the Founders who were at the Constitutional Convention began to write essays called the Federalist Papers. The Federalist Papers supported the passage of the U.S. Constitution. The writers of the Federalist Papers were James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay 
The Federalist Papers included 85 essays about 
The Bill of Rights to the U.S. Constitution.

– May 1788. All of the writers of the Federalist Papers signed the essays with the name “Publius” 
The people who supported the Constitution agreed to add 
amendments to the Constitution that included a list of rights. An amendment is a change to the Constitution 
Once the supporters of the Constitution 
agreed to add a list of rights, many more people in the United States decided to support the Constitution. In 1791, the first 10 amendments were added to the Constitution. They include some of the basic rights of U.S. citizens and individuals living in the United States. The first 10 amendments to the Constitution are called the Bill of Rights 
The Federalist Papers supported 
passing the U.S. Constitution.
RIGHTS & FREEDOMS OF EVERYONE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY 
There are five rights or freedoms in the First Amendment . 
5 rights listed in the First Amendment
• Speech

United States.
One right or freedom in the First Amendment is the Freedom of Speech. People in the U.S. have the 
right to say or write what they want without fear of going to jail.
People can use their Freedom of Speech to participate in American democracy. For example, people can 
participate in American democracy by writing to a newspaper or publicly giving their opinion about  an issue or policy 
Another right or freedom in the First Amendment is the Freedom of Religion. People in the U.S. 
have the right to practice any religion, or not practice a religion. 
The other amendments in the Bill of Rights list other types of rights. For example, the Sixth Amendment lists some of the rights for people who have been accused of breaking the law. The Sixth Amendment says that a person accused of breaking the law has the right to a trial with a jury to decide if that person is innocent or guilty. RESPONSIBILITIES OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES  
Everyone living in the United States is responsible for following the 
“rule of law.”  This means that everyone living in the United States 
must obey the law 
For example, it is the law that everyone living in the United States must pay income taxes. The law says that each year, people are required to send in a federal income tax form to the U.S. government. The last day that people can send in their federal income tax forms is April 15 
Another responsibility for men who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents is to register for the Selective Service. All men who are U.S.  citizens or legal residents and between the age of 18 and 26 must  register for the Selective Service

responsibility that is only for U.S. citizens 49, 50 . Participating in 
federal elections is how U.S. citizens vote for U.S. Representatives, U.S. Senators, and the President.

ONE NATION, ONE PEOPLE: THE USCIS CIVICS TEST TEXTBOOK
EARLY AMERICAN HISTORY
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏Early American History.
 ❏The Colonial Period (1607 – 1776). ❏The people living in the North 
America before 1776. 
In the 1400s, some European countries developed ships that could sail 
across the ocean. Spain was the first country to send ships across the Atlantic Ocean. 
They did not know that the continents of North America and South 
America were between Europe and Asia. North and South America are sometimes called the Americas. 
The Europeans also did not know that there were millions of people 
living in North and South America. The people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived are called Native Americans 
By the 1500s, Spain had created colonies across North America and South America. Soon, other European countries like France, Portugal, and England started creating their own colonies in the Americas.  
NATIVE AMERICANS  
Native Americans lived in North and South America for around 20,000 
years before the Europeans arrived. 
There were many different tribes of Native American people living 
in the Americas. Each Native American tribe had their own culture, religion, traditions, language, and form of government. Many tribes moved around and relied on hunting and gathering for food. There were also tribes that stayed in one place and relied on farming for food. Some tribes lived in large cities and had complex forms of government and written languages. 

================NEW PAGE================

Before the Europeans arrived, 
there were more than 50 million Native Americans living in North and South America. More than 10 million Native Americans lived on the land in North America that became the United States. After Europeans arrived in North and South America, millions of Native Americans died from diseases brought by Europeans. Many Native Americans also died from wars and conflicts with Europeans. 
By the 1600s, there were about 6 
million Native Americans living in the Americas, and about 1 million Native Americans still living in North America.
In 1607, the country of England created its first permanent settlement in North America. 
It was called Jamestown. This started the 
period in American history called the Colonial Period. It lasted from 1607 – 1775. During the Colonial Period, England created 13 colonies in North America. 
Many colonists who settled in Jamestown 
came to North America because they wanted economic opportunities 
Some 
colonists believed that it would be easier to buy land for farming in North America. Others thought they could find valuable metals like gold and silver. 
The first years in Jamestown were difficult 
for the colonists. Many died from hunger, disease, or the cold winter weather.  Colonists and Native Americans also fought over who would control the land. Both colonists and Native Americans died during the fighting. 
After the first few years, the colonists in Jamestown 
began to have more success, and the number of colonists grew. They moved to new areas and started growing crops like tobacco and later cotton. The colonists made a lot of money selling these crops to England. They wanted to grow more crops, but they did not have enough people to work on the farms. 
Other European countries that had colonies took 
people from Africa to the Americas and sold them as slaves 
Another term for “slave” is an “enslaved 
person. ” An enslaved person is someone who is forced to work with no freedom. Millions of enslaved African people were forced on ships and taken to North and South America.  
The first group of enslaved Africans were brought to 
Jamestown in 1619. Enslaved Africans were forced to work on farms in terrible conditions.

THE 13 ORIGINAL COLONIES
As more colonists came to Jamestown, they started to create other settlements. Soon these settlements became known as the colony of Virginia. 
In 1620, a group of English colonists called the Pilgrims created the 
colony of Massachusetts. Many of these colonists came to North America because they wanted religious freedom 
Soon more colonists from England began coming to North America and created more colonies. They created 13 colonies on the East Coast of North America.
The Colonial Period ended when the colonists living in the 13 original 
colonies declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776. 
“Pilgrims Going to Church, ” by George 
started in 1607, the colonists were part of the country of England. England is on the island of Britain. The country of Scotland is also on the island of Britain. In 1707, England and Scotland became one country called Great Britain. After 1707, the 13 original colonies were part of Great Britain.
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR & 
THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏The American Revolutionary War .
 ❏The Declaration of Independence.  ❏The creation of the United States of 
America. 
CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR 
In 1775, the colonists went to war with Great Britain. This war 
was called the American Revolutionary War.  During the American Revolutionary War, the colonists declared their independence from Great Britain, and they created the United States of America. The American Revolutionary War started in 1775. It ended in 1783 when Great Britain signed a treaty that said they agreed that the United States was an independent country. 
The reason the colonists fought the British was because they did not 
have self-government 
When the colonists created the 13 colonies, each colony had its own colonial congress. A colonial congress was a legislative branch that made laws for each colony. 
Great Britain allowed the colonies to have a colonial congress as long 
as they paid taxes to Great Britain, obeyed all other British laws, and provided Great Britain with materials like cotton, tobacco, and rice. 
In the 1760s, Great Britain was fighting a war both in Europe and in 
North America. Great Britain needed help paying for the war. They passed laws that increased taxes on the 13 original colonies. The colonists did not think it was fair that Great Britain raised their 

================NEW PAGE================

taxes without allowing representatives from the colonies to vote on it. 
Many colonists began to protest against the taxes because they thought it was not fair to have taxation without representation 
Great Britain responded by passing laws to punish the colonists. Great Britain made the colonists pay more taxes and made the colonial congresses illegal. These taxes and laws made the colonists even angrier. Many colonists no longer wanted to be part of Great Britain. They wanted to create their own country and govern themselves.  
In 1775, colonists in Massachusetts began fighting the British. Soon, 
all 13 original colonies were fighting against Great Britain. The colonists created an army, and George Washington was named the general of the colonial army during the American Revolutionary War. This is one reason that George Washington is called the “Father of Our Country” 
“George Washington at Princeton, ” by 
The Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, 1776. 
The Declaration of Independence announced our independence 
from Great Britain. This is why we celebrate Independence 
Day on July 4th.
Another word for “Declaration” is “statement. ” Another word for  “Independence” is “freedom. ” The Declaration of Independence is a “statement of freedom. ”
Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence 
In the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote that 
everyone has the right to:

 ●liberty; and

WINNING THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR
The United States stopped fighting with Great Britain in 1781. The British Army surrendered to the United 
States at the Battle of Yorktown in the state of Virginia. There was no more fighting, but the American Revolutionary War did not officially end until the U.S. and Great Britain signed a treaty in 1783. In the treaty, Great Britain agreed that the United States won the American Revolutionary War and that the United States was an independent nation.
Benjamin Franklin was a Founder who was famous for many things. One thing Benjamin Franklin was famous for was being a diplomat

A NEW GOVERNMENT AND  
AN EXPANDING NATION
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏The Constitutional Convention.
 ❏The conflicts caused by expansion. ❏The expansion of U.S. territory from  
the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean.
The Constitution was written in 1787. It was written 11 years 
after the Declaration of Independence was adopted in 1776.
After the United States won the American Revolutionary War, many 
people were not happy with the way the country was being governed. Many of the states disagreed on issues like trade, taxes, and other laws. 
Some of the country’s leaders like George Washington, Alexander 
Hamilton, and James Madison believed that the United States needed a new government. 
In 1787, leaders from all the 13 original states met in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania to create a new government. This meeting was called the Constitutional Convention. The Founders wrote the Constitution at the Constitutional Convention 
After the Founders wrote the Constitution, the 13 original states had to vote for the Constitution. 
Not everyone in the country wanted the new Constitution. James 
Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay wrote papers to support passing the U.S. Constitution. These papers are called the Federalist Papers 
They published the Federalist Papers in 
newspapers across the United States.When the states voted to pass the Constitution, the United States created a new government. When the new government was created, George Washington was elected the first President of the United States 
He served as President from 1789 – 1797. George Washington is also known as the “Father 
of Our Country”.
George Washington takes the Oath of 
Office at Federal Hall in New York City.

THE U.S. BETWEEN 1787 – 1803
When the Constitution was written in 1787, the U.S. had 13 states on the East Coast of North America. The 
United States also claimed to own the land between the 13 original states and the Mississippi River as U.S. territory. The word “claim” means that other European countries that created colonies in the Americas agreed that this territory was owned by the United States. 
At this time, there were still over 600,000 Native Americans living on the land claimed by the United States. 
Native American tribes had lived for thousands of years in the territory that the U.S. claimed. They did not agree that the U.S. owned the land. This led to many conflicts and wars in the 1800s because Native Americans were forced to defend their people, their culture, and their land. 
THE LOUISIANA TERRITORY
In 1803, the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory from France 
The Louisiana Territory included 
a large amount of land between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. France sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States because they needed money to pay for wars they were fighting in Europe. 
This map shows the U.S. in 1803 in green and the Louisiana Territory in pink.When the U.S. purchased the Louisiana Territory from France, more people began moving west into the new territory. This led to more conflicts and wars between people from the United States and Native Americans.  
For example, between the 1830s – 1850s, people from five Native American nations in the southern United 
States were forced to move from their homeland to land in the Louisiana Territory. The five Native American nations were the Cherokee, Muscogee, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw. This event is called the “Trail of Tears” because thousands of people died from disease and starvation on the trail during the journey. 
Throughout the 1800s, people from the United States continued to move West. This led to more conflicts 
between Native Americans and people from the U.S., and more Native Americans were forced to move off their land. 
Native Americans are also called American Indians. Today, there are over 500 American Indian tribes in the 
United States.
This map shows the U.S. in the 1850s.

THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN WAR
In 1845, Texas became the 28th state to join the United States. Until 1836, Texas was part of Mexico. Texas fought for independence from Mexico and became its own country from 1836 – 1845.  
At that time, Mexico still claimed much of the land in the southwest 
between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean. Mexico also wanted Texas to be part of Mexico again. 
In 1846, the U.S. went to war with Mexico over Texas and other land 
that Mexico controlled in the southwest. This war is called the Mexican-American War. 
The Mexican-American War was one war fought by the United 
States in the 1800s 
The U.S. won the Mexican-American War in 1848. After the war, the United States and Mexico signed a treaty. In the treaty, Mexico agreed that Texas was part of the United States. Mexico also agreed to sell the land it claimed in the southwest to the U.S. The territory the U.S. gained from Mexico later became the states of California, Nevada, and Utah. It also included territory that became parts of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming. 
Today, the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas all 
border Mexico

By 1860, there were 33 states in the United States. The Atlantic Ocean 
bordered the U.S. on the East Coast 
89, and the Pacific Ocean 
bordered the U.S. on the West Coast. The U.S. also claimed all of 
the land between Canada and Mexico that today makes up the first 48 states to join the United States. 
The growth of the country not only led to conflicts with Native 
Americans and Mexico, it also led to conflicts between people from the United States moving to the West. The biggest conflict was over slavery.

THE CIVIL WAR
In this chapter , you will learn about: 
 ❏Slavery during the 1800s. 
 ❏The Civil War . ❏Abraham Lincoln.
 ❏The end of slavery in the U.S.
During the 1800s, the states in the southern United States began to 
depend more on growing cotton and other crops for sale to countries in Europe. Landowners depended on enslaved people to do the work.
As the U.S. gained more territory, many people who owned slaves in 
the South wanted to move to the new states and territories in the West. They wanted to find more land to grow crops like cotton, corn, and tobacco. They also wanted slavery to be legal in the West so they could bring enslaved people to work on the farms and grow crops. 
Most northern states passed laws against slavery, and many people 
in the North did not want slavery to be legal in the West. When people from the North and the South began moving west in the 1800s, there were many conflicts about whether slavery should be legal in the new states and territories. Congress began to pass laws that said where slavery was legal in the West and where it was not.
Between 1800 -1860 there were people who thought that slavery should be illegal and that everyone in the 
U.S. should have civil rights. For example, Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery and became an important civil rights leader in the 1800s. He is famous for giving speeches and writing books about ending slavery and protecting civil rights for all people. 
Susan B. Anthony is another person who fought 
for civil rights during the 1800s. She agreed with Frederick Douglass that slavery should be illegal. Susan B. Anthony also fought for women’s rights 
She wanted women to be treated equally to men, 
and she wanted women to have the right to vote in the United States.

In 1861, the U.S. started fighting the Civil War. The Civil War is one war that the U.S. fought during the 
1800s. The Civil War was fought between the North and the South 73 between 1861 – 1865.
One problem that led to the Civil War was slavery. The states in the South believed that slavery 
should be legal. They were afraid that states in the North wanted to make slavery illegal in the whole country. The states in the North were also afraid that the Southern states wanted to make slavery legal in the whole country. 
The Civil War started in 1861 after 11 states in the South left the United States and tried to create their own 
country. They called their country the Confederate States of America. The states in the North were still called the United States of America.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN
Abraham Lincoln led the United States during the Civil War. He 
was the 16th President of the United States, and he served as President from 1861 – 1865. 
During the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation  
Proclamation 
The Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves 
in most Southern states. “Emancipation” is another word for 
“freedom. ” “Proclamation” is another word for “announcement. ” The 
Emancipation Proclamation announced that people who were enslaved in most Southern states were free. Most people enslaved in Southern states were not actually freed until after the Civil War was over. 
The North won the Civil War when the South surrendered in April 1865. 
A few days after the South surrendered to the North, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated. The word “assassinated” means that a person is murdered for political reasons.

After the Civil War was over, all the people who were enslaved in Southern states were freed. On June 19, 
1865, enslaved people living in Galveston, Texas, became the last to learn that the Civil War was over and that they were free. June 19th became a holiday called Juneteenth. Today, Juneteenth is a national U.S. holiday that recognizes and celebrates the end of slavery in the United States

By the 1900s, more people in the United States were moving to cities to 
work in factories, and immigrants from all over the world were moving to the U.S. The United States’ economy was starting to grow, and soon the U.S. would begin to increase the size of its military. 
In 1914, a war started in Europe. When the war started, it was called The 
Great War. Today, the Great War is called World War I. There were many countries fighting on each side of the war during World War I. 
World War I is one war fought by the United States in the 1900s 
. World War I was fought by countries from around the world from 1914 
– 1918, but the U.S. did not join the war until 1917.  The U.S. fought in World War I from 1917 – 1918. 
World War I ended on November 11, 1918. Today, we celebrate Veterans’

THE GREAT DEPRESSION
When President Roosevelt was elected in 1933, the U.S. 
was in the Great Depression. The Great Depression was the worst time for the U.S. economy in American history. 
The economic system in the United States is called a 
“capitalist economy” 
It is also sometimes called 
a “market economy”. In a market economy, the 
government does not control the economy. Also, people are free to start a business and make money. 
The Great Depression had terrible effects on the 
American economy. During the Great Depression, banks and businesses around the country closed, and many people could not a get a job. A lot of people in the U.S. lost their homes and their money.

In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt was elected the 32nd President of the United States. Franklin 
Roosevelt was the longest-serving President in U.S. history, and he was elected President four times. He was President from 1933 – 1945, and he died while serving as President in 1945. In 1951, the 22nd amendment was added to the Constitution. An amendment is a change to the Constitution 
The 22nd Amendment says a person can only be elected President two times.  
Franklin Roosevelt was 
President during two important periods in American history. He was President during the Great Depression and World War II

the Declaration of War against Japan 
In 1939, World War II started when Germany attacked Poland. Germany 
then began to attack other European countries. Japan and Italy agreed to fight on the same side as Germany. 
World War II was one war that the U.S. fought in the 1900s 
The U.S. fought in World War II from 1941 – 1945.On December 7, 1941, Japan attacked the United States at a U.S. naval 
base in Hawaii called Pearl Harbor. On December 8, President Roosevelt announced that the U.S. would enter World War II. Later that day, Congress voted to declare war. The power to declare war is one power that belongs to the federal government under the Constitution 
During World War II, the U.S. fought Japan, Germany, and Italy.
The U.S. did not fight these countries alone. The United Kingdom, France, Russia, and other countries fought against Japan, Germany, and Italy.  World War II ended in 1945 when Germany and Japan surrendered.
When the United States fought in World War II, the U.S. and Russia fought 
on the same side. Russia controlled many nearby countries. Russia, and the countries it controlled, were called the Soviet Union. The U.S. and the Soviet Union did not trust each other. After World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union became involved in the Cold War. 
During the Cold War, the main concern of the United States was 
the spread of communism 
Communism is a type of government 
in which the government plans the economy and controls most of the resources. Also, in most communist countries, the government is controlled by one political party. Russia and all the countries in the Soviet Union were communist. Other countries like China and North Korea were also becoming communist. The U.S. wanted to stop other countries around the world from becoming communist.  The Cold War did not have soldiers from the U.S. and the Soviet Union fighting each other in battles. Instead, the U.S. and the Soviet Union had diplomats and spies who used information and threats against each other. 
In 1953, Dwight Eisenhower became the 34th President of the United 
States. He served from 1953 – 1961. Before he was President, Eisenhower was a general in World War II 
While he was 
President, the U.S. and the Soviet Union were building large armies in case they went to war. The U.S. and the Soviet Union also began trying to send rockets into space. In 1957, the Soviet Union became the first country to send a satellite into space. In 1969, the U.S. became the first country to land a person on the moon.

THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
During the 1900s, many states had laws that discriminated against 
people based on their race. Some of these laws said that people of different races had to go to separate schools, eat in separate restaurants, and live in separate neighborhoods. Other laws made it difficult for people to vote based on their race. Many of the states that had these laws wanted to separate Black Americans from White Americans. Some states had laws that discriminated against Latino Americans and Asian Americans.
Soon after World War II ended, many people in the United States began 
a movement to end racial discrimination. The movement to end racial discrimination in the United States is called the Civil Rights Movement 
 During the Civil Rights Movement, many people worked to end the laws that separated people based on their race or made it difficult for people to vote based on their race. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr., fought for civil rights 
He was a leader in the Civil 
Rights Movement who organized peaceful protests against racial discrimination and laws that separated people by race. A lot of his work focused on fighting for civil rights for Black Americans, but he wanted all people in the United States to have civil rights.   
There were also many Latino Americans, Asian Americans, and people 
from other communities that helped lead the fight for civil rights. For example, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta were civil rights leaders from the Latino American community. 
The Civil Rights Movement led to many 
changes in the United States. Martin Luther King, Jr., and other civil rights leaders were able to convince Congress to pass two laws that protect civil rights and voting rights. In 1964, Congress passed a law called the Civil Rights Act. This law says it is illegal to discriminate against someone based on their race, religion, sex, or national origin. In 1965, Congress passed another law called the Voting Rights Act. This law says that states cannot deny people the right to vote based on their race. 
Today, Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is a national 
holiday 
We celebrate Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Day on the third Monday in January.
