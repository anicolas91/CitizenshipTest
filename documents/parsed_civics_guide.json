It is the oldest written \nconstitution in the world. The Constitution sets up the government \nand protects the basic rights of people living in the United States. \nThe Constitution was written during the period when the country was created. Another word for created is “founded. ” The period when the country was created is called the Founding Era. In 1787, famous leaders from around the country like George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton came to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a Constitutional Convention. The leaders who met at the Constitutional Convention are sometimes called the Founders. The Founders wrote the Constitution at the Constitutional Convention \nWhen the Founders wrote the Constitution in 1787, it had a Preamble and seven sections. There have been changes made to the Constitution since it was written.  A change to the Constitution is called an amendment \nThere are 27 amendments to the \nConstitution. The 27 amendments are listed after the seven \nsections of the original Constitution. \nThe beginning of the Constitution is called the Preamble. The Preamble \nto the Constitution explains why the Founders wrote the Constitution. \nThe Preamble also says that under the Constitution, the people of the \nUnited States will have self-government. This means that the people of the United States are not governed by a king or a queen. Instead, the people of the United States govern themselves. The people of the United States govern themselves by electing representatives who serve in the local, state, and U.S. governments.\nThe idea of self-government is in the first three words of the  \nConstitution. These words are, “We the people” \nThe Constitution of the United States."

The last day that people can send in their federal income tax forms is April 15 \nAnother responsibility for men who are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents is to register for the Selective Service.

Landowners depended on enslaved people to do the work.\nAs the U.S. gained more territory, many people who owned slaves in \nthe South wanted to move to the new states and territories in the West. They wanted to find more land to grow crops like cotton, corn, and tobacco. They also wanted slavery to be legal in the West so they could bring enslaved people to work on the farms and grow crops. \nMost northern states passed laws against slavery, and many people \nin the North did not want slavery to be legal in the West. When people from the North and the South began moving west in the 1800s, there were many conflicts about whether slavery should be legal in the new states and territories. Congress began to pass laws that said where slavery was legal in the West and where it was not.\nBetween 1800 -1860 there were people who thought that slavery should be illegal and that everyone in the \nU.S. should have civil rights. For example, Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery and became an important civil rights leader in the 1800s. He is famous for giving speeches and writing books about ending slavery and protecting civil rights for all people. \nSusan B. Anthony is another person who fought \nfor civil rights during the 1800s. She agreed with Frederick Douglass that slavery should be illegal. Susan B. Anthony also fought for women’s rights \nShe wanted women to be treated equally to men, \nand she wanted women to have the right to vote in the United States.\n Frederick Douglass.

The Civil War was fought between the North and the South 73 between 1861 – 1865.\nOne problem that led to the Civil War was slavery. The states in the South believed that slavery \nshould be legal.

The states in the North were also afraid that the Southern states wanted to make slavery legal in the whole country. \nThe Civil War started in 1861 after 11 states in the South left the United States and tried to create their own \ncountry.
